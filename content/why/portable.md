The configuration based approach of Nextflow makes it possible to write a workflow 
on your laptop and easily run it elsewhere. Nextflow supports most common HPC schedulers,
Amazon and Google cloud services, and Kubernetes. The workflow code can stay constant while 
specifying parameters for each executor in a configuration. 

Share your workflows easily with your collaborators or the world.
